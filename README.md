# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End Project Overview & Technologies

This project, developed during Sprint 12, focuses on building the backend server for the WTWR (What to Wear?) application. The goal is to enable data handling and user interaction through a RESTful API.

We implemented standard HTTP methods — GET, POST, PUT, DELETE — to retrieve, create, update, and delete resources. These actions are handled through an API built with Express.js and powered by Node.js, allowing efficient communication between the client and server.

MongoDB was used as the database, with Mongoose managing schemas and interactions. We also integrated middleware for user simulation, request parsing, and testing support.
